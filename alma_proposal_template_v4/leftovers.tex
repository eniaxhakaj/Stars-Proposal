%The study of CV helps us gain more insight on hydrogen rich accretion discs, stellar evolution in interacting binaries as well as the possibility of testing stellar dynamo theories. \textbf{smith} \textbf{Warner 1995 for a review}

%based on which they can be classified into two main categories: dwarf and classical novae. Dwarf Novae happen once in a few weeks and are due to instabilities in the accretion disc of a CV, which cause primarily an overall increase in the temperature of the accretion disc. As the temperature increases above a critical limit, the viscosity of the gas in the accretion disc changes, and as a consequence, the matter from the accretion disc starts falling much faster towards the White Dwarf.
